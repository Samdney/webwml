    <br>
    
    <p>
    The latest release of Tor can be found on the <a
    href="<page download/download>">download</a> page. We have packages for Debian,
    Red Hat, Gentoo, etc there too. If you're
    using Ubuntu, don't use the default packages: use <a
    href="<page docs/debian>#ubuntu">our deb repository</a> instead.
    </p>
    
    <p>If you're building from source, first install <a
    href="http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/">libevent</a>, and
    make sure you have openssl and zlib (including the -devel packages if
    applicable). Then run:<br>
    <tt>tar xzf tor-<version-stable>.tar.gz; cd tor-<version-stable></tt><br>
    <tt>./configure &amp;&amp; make</tt><br>
    Now you can run tor as <tt>src/or/tor</tt>, or you can run <tt>make install</tt>
    (as root if necessary) to install it into /usr/local/, and then you can
    start it just by running <tt>tor</tt>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Tor comes configured as a client by default. It uses a built-in
    default configuration file, and most people won't need to change any of
    the settings. Tor is now installed.

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#using">Step Two: Configure your applications to use Tor</a></h2>
    <br>
    
    <p>
    If you want to use Tor for anonymous web browsing, please use <a
    href="<page projects/torbrowser>">Tor Browser</a>. It comes with
    readily configured Tor and a browser patched for better anonymity.
    To use SOCKS directly (for instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), you
    can point your application directly at Tor (localhost
    port 9050, or port 9150 for Tor Browser), but see <a href="<page docs/faq>#TBBSocksPort">this FAQ
    entry</a> for why this may be dangerous. For applications
    that support neither SOCKS nor HTTP, take a look at <a href="https://code.google.com/p/torsocks/">torsocks</a>
    or <a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>For information on how to Torify other applications, check out the
    <a href="<wiki>doc/TorifyHOWTO">Torify HOWTO</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's ability
    to connect to itself (this includes something like SELinux on Fedora
    Core 4), be sure to allow connections from your local applications to
    Tor (local port 9050). If your firewall blocks outgoing connections,
    punch a hole so it can connect to at least TCP ports 80 and 443, and
    then see <a href="<wikifaq>#FirewalledClient">this FAQ entry</a>.
    If your SELinux config is not allowing tor to run
    correctly, create a file named booleans.local in the directory
    /etc/selinux/targeted.  Edit this file in your favorite text editor
    and insert "allow_ypbind=1".  Restart your machine for this change
    to take effect.
    </p>
    
    <p>If it's still not working, look at <a
    href="<page docs/faq>#DoesntWork">this
    FAQ entry</a> for hints.</p>
